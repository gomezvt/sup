# Sup? City
This repository manages code for the "Sup? City" app, not currently available on the App Store, which is a travel/tourism iOS app supported on the iPhone and iPad. "Sup? City" displays nine categories (e.g. "Shopping", "Travel") and a search functionality for a user to find places of interest based on their location with support from the Yelp API.

## Supported Devices
This project is supported on the iPhone and iPad, with a deployment target of iOS 10.
